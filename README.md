# whitenoisegenerator
White noise generator using MATLAB



It is a part of project under Karnarogyam Pvt. ltd.
Main aim of the project is to make a device whcih outputs a sound of particular frequency. Device will be a Ipod kind of thing which is totally portable and sound can be heard through earphone. 

They got motivation to make this device from a disease called Tannitus which is commonly seen in many people. Doctors have not found a cure to this disease but it can be nummed by playing sound for particular frequency and for particular duration in their ear.

I have helped them in producing sound through MATLAB which code has been written completely by me.

Now we are working on making the device using STM32 and playing sound through storing it in its flash memory.

I have practised STM32 code too but i cant share it here as they are cofidential. But i will surely add code which lead me to that thing. Like accessing data from UART and using Flash memory.
