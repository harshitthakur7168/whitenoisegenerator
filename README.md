# whitenoisegenerator
White noise generator using MATLAB



It is a part of project under Karnarogyam Pvt. ltd.
Main aim of the project is to make a device which outputs a sound of particular frequency. Device will be a Ipod kind of thing which is totally portable and sound can be heard through earphones. 

They got motivation to make this device from a disease called Tannitus which is commonly seen in many people. Doctors have not found a cure to this disease but it can be nummed by playing sound for particular frequency and for particular duration in their ear.

I have helped them in producing sound through MATLAB which code has been written completely by me.

We are using STM32 as our microcontroller and aiming to implement the whole project based on it. We hope to get it done by october.
